I transitioned into a tech leadership position almost two years ago. As a seasoned IC techie who recently transitioned into a leadership role, it has taken me a while to learn and realize the most important responsibilities of my role. Recently, I attempted to find more meaning and fulfilment in my work through spirituality. In this post, I share what I have learned about the intersection of leadership and spirituality.

**Dichotomy of transition**

As a seasoned techie who has always contributed as a hands-on engineer in solving problems and delivering products through my code, writing code and solving technically challenging problems myself led to the highest level of satisfaction for me. When transitioning to a leadership position, I was expected to get things delivered with the help of my team. I was split between the dichotomy of doing things myself vs. getting things done by others. There were primarily two reasons for this:

1. I constantly felt insecure about missing out on learning from hands-on work.
2. I always believed that doing things myself was faster and led to better outcomes.

I am sure a lot of leaders feel the same early on in their leadership journey. It is also very normal for this feeling to linger for a longer period of time.

Over the past two years in my leadership journey, two concepts have really helped me overcome this discomfort:

* **Oneness consciousness**
* **Service creates bliss**

First, I will define these two concepts before discussing their applications in my work life.

**Oneness consciousness**

> The concept of oneness consciousness delves into the fact that this entire universe is one. All actions by individuals affect everyone else. Hence, all actions should be directed toward the welfare of everyone.

**Service to others**

> The highest level of bliss or happiness is created through service or helping others. Multiple studies support this idea ([ref1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78nsxRxbf4w&t=65s&ab_channel=TEDxTalks), [ref2](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/self-obsession-happiness-dante/680017/)).

**Oneness consciousness as a tech leader**

As a tech leader, the organization’s goal can serve as the compass for what oneness consciousness means in this context. A prerequisite for this is that a leader believes in the organization’s goal.

In my current stint, the organization’s motto is to help people grow. For me, bringing oneness consciousness to work means aligning all my efforts toward achieving this goal. This has naturally helped me prioritize all my actions toward helping people grow. Hence, whenever there is a dichotomy between actions that help myself and actions that help others, I consciously try to prioritize others’ goals over my own.

You might think that leading this way would cause suffering to the self. There might be people in the organization whose actions are not aligned with the organization’s goals. In such cases, it is okay to let them go (after providing sufficient coaching and opportunity). Remember:

> Actions with **good intentions** and **oneness consciousness** in perspective, even if they hurt a few people, will lead to overall happiness in the ecosystem.

> Actions with **bad intentions (focused on oneself)** might make a few people happy but will lead to overall unhappiness.

**Service to others**

One of my passions is education. I have been fortunate enough to have a very nurturing upbringing. I had the opportunity to be coached well in high school, which helped me get into a great undergrad school. This opened the door to exciting opportunities in the industry. I feel humbled by these opportunities and see it as my moral responsibility to help others achieve their aspirations.

As a leader in the tech industry, I have a significant opportunity to impact the lives of my team members. From creating new opportunities for the people around me to enabling them to achieve their individual goals, I see this as a chance to create collective happiness. This circles back to oneness consciousness, as happy and fulfilled individuals will always contribute to the organization’s goals. Eventually, I believe I can create more leaders who will go on to impact the lives of many others.

Oneness consciousness leads to happy and healthy ecosystem

In my upcoming posts, I will delve deeper into the concepts of oneness consciousness and service to others. I will also introduce micro-concepts at the intersection of leadership and spirituality. Signing off with more mindfulness and awareness!
