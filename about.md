  <strong><i>To be able to lead with mindfullness and feeling of oneness is the greatest gift for a leader</i></strong>
</p>

I am an engineering leader with a passion for building and nurturing high-performing engineering teams.

Currently, I am an Engineering Manager at PayZapp ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hdfcbank.payzapp&hl=en-US)/[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/payzapp-upi-pixel-credit-card/id6443480917)). I have a team of 10 mobile engineers, both on Android and iOS. My team has improved the payment funnel performance by ~70% in the last year and shipped complex products like autopayment and UPI Circles.

In the past, I have worked on building and shipping Android SDKs focusing on OTP-less second factor authentication and PCI DSS compliant cards solution for our customers and successfully shipped these to 15+ customers with the likes of PostPe, Fampay, Mobikwik and OneCard.

Previously, I was the founding engineer with a music education startup where I built and scaled the Android application, helping people learn music.
