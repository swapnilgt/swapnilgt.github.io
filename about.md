  <strong><i>To be able to lead with mindfullness and feeling of oneness is the greatest gift for a leader</i></strong>
</p>

I am an engineering leader with a passion for building and nurturing high-performing engineering teams.

I am an Engineering Manager at PayZapp ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hdfcbank.payzapp&hl=en-US)/[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/payzapp-upi-pixel-credit-card/id6443480917)) with an experiencce of 12 years. I have a team of 10 mobile engineers, both on Android and iOS. My team has improved the payment funnel performance by ~70% in the last year and shipped large and complex products like [UPI with Wallet](https://youtu.be/RbnTE8PYnuY?si=dhjNYuXF9KZ1pXZ6), [UPI Circles](https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi-circle/product-overview#:~:text=UPI%20Circle%20is%20a%20solution%20where%20a%20payer,with%20minimum%20intervention%20and%20with%20adequate%20risk%20mitigations.) and Autopayment solution for PayZapp merchants.

In the past, I have worked on building and shipping Android SDKs focusing on OTP-less second factor authentication and PCI DSS compliant cards solution for our customers and successfully shipped these to 15+ customers with the likes of [PostPe](https://xploringindia.in/bharatpe-enters-the-buy-now-pay-later-segment-as-it-launched-postpe/), [Fampay](https://blog.famapp.in/blog/zetas-fusion-to-power-fampays-cashless-payments-for-gen-z/), Mobikwik and [OneCard](https://www.getonecard.app/blog/onecard-credit-card-swipe-to-pay/).
